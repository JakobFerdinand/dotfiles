# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the configuration files for various tools and programs.
Most of them start with a `.` - that´s why they are called `dotfiles`.

## How to managed dotfiles

I use a **git bare repository** to manage my dotfiles.  
I found the idea on [Derek Taylor´s Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM&t=905s). His [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles) page is also a great resource for configuration ideas.
